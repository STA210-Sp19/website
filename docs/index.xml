      <description>This page is under construction and will be updated soon.
To uphold the Duke Community Standard:  - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;  - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and  - I will act if the Standard is compromised. Cheating on exams or plagiarism on homework assignments, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the Duke Community Standard, and will not be tolerated.</description>
