### Questions

1. Describe how you would conduct exploratory data analysis. What plots and/or summary statistics would you include? 

```{r warning = F, message = F}
model1 <- multinom(viewcat ~ site + viewenc + prenumbCent + preletCent + ageCent,
                   data = sesame)
kable(tidy(model1, conf.int=TRUE, exponentiate = FALSE),
      format = "markdown")
```

2. Interpret the intercept, -0.225. 

3. Interpret the effect of the numbers pretest on the odds of viewership. 

4. The primary objective of the experiment was to understand the effect of encouragement `viewenc` on viewership. Does encouragement have a significant effect on viewership? If so, describe the effect. Otherwise, explain why not. 

5. We want to test if there are any significant interactions with `viewenc` and the pretests. We create a model that includes the variables from `model1` along with `viewenc*preletCent` and `viewenc*prenumbCent`. 

```{r echo = T, warning = F, message = F}
model2 <- multinom(viewcat ~ site + viewenc + prenumbCent + preletCent + ageCent + 
                     viewenc*preletCent + viewenc*prenumbCent,
                   data = sesame)
```

The results from the drop-in-deviance test are shown below. Is there evidence of a significant interaction effect? Explain. 

```{r}
anova(model1, model2, test = "Chisq")
```

6. Describe the plots, tables, and/or calculations you would create using the residuals to assess model fit.
