## Packages and Data


```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(modelr)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

```{r data}
movie_scores <- fandango %>%
  rename(tomatometer = rottentomatoes, audience = rottentomatoes_user)
```

---

## rottentomatoes.com

Can ratings from movie critics be used to predict the ratings from movie goers?

--

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/movie-rating-2.png")
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/movie-rating-1.png")
```

---

## Critic vs. Audience Ratings

- To answer this question, we will analyze the critic and audience scores from rottentomatoes.com.  
    - The data was first used in the article [Be Suspicious of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandango's](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).

- Variables: 
    - `tomatometer`: Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for the film (0 - 100)
    - `audience`: Rotten Tomatoes user score for the film (0 - 100)

---

## `glimpse` of the data

```{r}
glimpse(movie_scores)
```


---

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(x=tomatometer,y=audience)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title="Audience Score vs. Tomatometer") + 
  theme_gray()
```

---
.small[
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(x=tomatometer,y=audience)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE) +
  labs(title="Audience Score vs. Tomatometer") + 
  theme_gray()
```
]

---

## Terminology

- `audience` is the <font class="vocab">response variable $(Y)$</font>
    - variable whose variation we want to understand / variable we wish to predict


- `tomatometer` is the <font class="vocab">predictor variable $(X)$</font>
    - variable used to account for variation in the outcome
    
---

## Least-Squares Regression

- There is some true relationship between $X$ and $Y$ that exists in the population

$$Y = f(X) + \epsilon$$

--

- If $f$ is approximated by a linear function, then we can write the relationship as 

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$$ 

--

- We'll estimate the slope and intercept of this linear function using *least-squares regrssion*

--

- We'll use statistical inference to determine if the relationship we observe in the data is significant or if it's due to random chance (we'll discuss this next class)

---

## Regression Model 

$$Y|X \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X,\sigma^2)$$

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/regression.png")
```

- $\sigma$: the standard deviation of $Y$ as a function of $X$ 

- **Assumption:** $\sigma$ is equal for all values of $X$

---

## Regression Model

.alert[
$$\color{blue}{Y|X \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X,\sigma^2)}$$
]

--

- For a single observation $(x_i, y_i)$

$$\color{blue}{y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i \hspace{10mm} \epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)}$$

--

- We want to use the $n$ observations $(x_1,y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ to estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. We will use *least-squares regression* estimates.

---

## Residuals

```{r echo=F, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
m <- lm(audience ~ tomatometer,data=movie_scores)
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(x=tomatometer,y=audience)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=tomatometer, xend=tomatometer, y=audience, yend=predict(m),color="red")) +
  labs(title="Audience Score vs. Tomatometer") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_gray()
```

The .vocab[residual] is the difference between the observed and predicted response.

---

## Residual Sum of Squares

- The residual for the $i^{th}$ observation is 

$$e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i =  y_i - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i)$$

--

- The *residual sum of squares* is 

$$RSS = e^2_1 + e^2_2 + \dots + e^2_n$$

--


- The .vocab[least-squares regression] approach chooses coefficients $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ to minimize RSS.

---

## Estimating Coefficients

- .vocab3[Slope:]

$$\hat\beta_1 = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2} = r\frac{s_y}{s_x}$$
such that $r$ is the correlation between $x$ And $y$.
<br>

- .vocab3[Intercept:] $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1\bar{x}$

---

## Least-Squares Model

```{r}
model <- lm(audience ~ tomatometer, data=movie_scores)
tidy(model)
```
<br><br>

$$\hat{\text{audience}} =  32.316 + 0.519 \times \text{tomatometer}$$

---

class: regular

## Interpreting Slope & Intercept 

- <font class="vocab">Slope: </font> Increase in the mean response for every one unit increase in the explanatory variable

- <font class="vocab">Intercept: </font> Mean response when the explanatory variable equals 0
<br><br>

--

- The regression equation for the Rotten Tomatoes data is
$$\hat{\text{audience}} =  32.316 + 0.519 \times \text{tomatometer}$$

.instructions[Write the interpretation of the slope and intercept]

---

## Nonsensical Intercept 

- Sometimes it doesn't make sense to interpret the intercept
  + Ex. The explanatory variable is not close to 0
  + The intercept is negative even though the response variable should always be positive
  
- The intercept helps the line fit the data as closely as possible

- It is fine to have a nonsensical intercept if it helps the model give better overall predictions 

---

class: regular 

### Should You Interpret the Intercept?

- Example 1: 
    - **Explanatory**: number of home runs in a baseball game
    - **Response**: attendance at the next baseball game
<br><br>


- Example 2:
    - **Explanatory**: height of a person
    - **Response**: weight of a person

## Model Assumptions 

---

## Assumptions for Regression 

1. <font class="vocab">Linearity: </font>The plot of the mean value for $y$ against $x$ falls on a straight line

2. <font class="vocab">Constant Variance: </font>The regression variance is the same for all values of $x$

3. <font class="vocab">Normality: </font> For a given $x$, the distribution of $y$ around its mean is Normal

4. <font class="vocab">Independence: </font>All observations are independent

---

## Checking Assumptions 

We can use plots of the residuals to check the assumptions for regression.

1. Scatterplot of $Y$ vs. $X$ (linearity). 
    - Check this before fitting the regression model.

2. Plot of residuals vs. predictor variable (constant variance, linearity)

3. Histogram and Normal QQ-Plot of residuals (Normality)

---

## Residuals vs. Predictor

- When all the assumptions are true, the values of the residuals reflect random (chance) error

- We can look at a plot of the residuals vs. the predictor variable

- There should be no distinguishable pattern in the residuals plot, i.e. the residuals should be randomly scattered 

- A non-random pattern suggests assumptions might be violated 

---

## Plots of Residuals

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/resid_plots.png")
```

---

```{r}
movie_scores <- movie_scores %>% mutate(residuals=resid(model))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(x=tomatometer, y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red")+
  labs(title="Residuals vs. Tomatometer") +
  theme_gray()
```

---

## Checking Normality

- Examine the distribution of the residuals to determine if the Normality assumption is satisfied 


- Plot the residuals in a histogram and a Normal QQ plot to visualize their distribution and assess Normality

- Most inference methods for regression are robust to some departures from Normality

---

## Normal QQ-Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '100%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/normal_qqplot.png")
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(x=residuals)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title="Distribution of Residuals") +
  theme_gray()
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(data=movie_scores,mapping=aes(sample=residuals)) + 
  stat_qq() + 
  stat_qq_line() +
  labs(title="Normal QQ Plot of Residuals") +
  theme_gray()
```

## Checking Independence

- Often, we can conclude that the independence assumption is sufficiently met based on a description of the data and how it was collected. 

- Two common violations of the independence assumption: 
    - <font class="vocab">Serial Effect</font>: If the data were collected over time, the residuals should be plotted in time order to determine if there is serial correlation 

    - <font class="vocab">Cluster Effect</font>: You can plot the residuals vs. a group identifier or use different markers (colors/shapes) in the residual plot to determine if there is a cluster effect.

### Example: Birth rate vs. Per Capita Income

- Pew Research did a <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/10/12/in-a-down-economy-fewer-births/" target="_blank">study in 2011</a> looking at how the economy's effect on birthrate in the United States. 
- We will look at data for Virginia and Washington D.C. years 2000 - 2009
- Birth rate: Births per 100,000 women ages 15-44
- Per Capita Income: average income per person
---
```{r, echo=F}
pew_data <- read_csv("data/birthrate.csv")
```
<small>
```{r}
ggplot(data=pew_data, mapping = aes(x=percapitaincome,y=birthrate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE) + 
  labs(title="Birth rate vs. Per Capita Income", 
       x="Per Capita Income ($)", y="Birth Rate") + 
  theme_gray()
```
</small>
---
## Birthrate vs. Per Capita Income
```{r}
pew_model <- lm(birthrate ~ percapitaincome,data=pew_data)
tidy(pew_model)
```
<br><br>
$$\hat{\text{Birth Rate}} = -18.2 + 0.0019 \times \text{ Per Capita Income}$$

## Assessing Model Fit
---
## $R^2$
We can use the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, to measure how well the model fits the data 
- $R^2$ is the proportion of variation in $Y$ that is explained by the regression line (reported as percentage)
- It is difficult to determine what's a "good" value of $R^2$. It depends on the context of the data.
---
## Calculating $R^2$
.instructions[
$$R^2 = \frac{\text{TSS} - \text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}} = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}}$$
]
- <font class="vocab">Total Sum of Squares: </font>Total variation in the $Y$'s before fitting the regression 
$$\text{TSS}= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = (n-1)s^2_y$$

- <font class="vocab">Residual Sum of Squares (RSS): </font>Total variation in the $Y$'s around the regression line (sum of squared residuals)
$$\text{RSS} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}[y_i - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i)]^2$$

---

## Rotten Tomatoes Data

```{r}
rsquare(model,movie_scores)
```

The Tomatometer score explains about `r round(rsquare(model,movie_scores) * 100,2)`% of the variation in audience scores on rottentomatoes.com.

## Git and GitHub

---

## Version control

- We will use GitHub as a platform for assignments and collaboration 

- But it's much more than that...

- It's actually designed for version control

---

## Versioning

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/lego-steps.png")
```

---

## Versioning 

with human readable messages

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/lego-steps-commit-messages.png")
```

---

### Why do we need version control?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/phd_comics_vc.gif")
```

---

## Git and GitHub tips

- **Git** is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word. 

--

- **GitHub** is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).

--

- There are a lot of Git commands and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

---

## Git and GitHub tips

- We will be doing git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio
    - If you Google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.

--

- There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/).
    - Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.

--

- You will start using git and GitHub in Lab 01 on Friday.

---
