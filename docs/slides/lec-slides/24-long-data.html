## US college completion rates

**What factors most effect completion rates at US colleges?**

&lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Response variable: &lt;/font&gt;

- **`rate`**: completion rate, i.e. number of degrees awarded per 100 students enrolled

&lt;font class = "vocab"&gt;Predictor variables: &lt;/font&gt;

- **`year02`**: years since 2002
precipitants (in $1000s)
- **`faculty`**: mean number of full-time faculty in 2002 - 2009
- **`tuition`**: mean yearly tuition between 2002 and 2009


```r
college &lt;- read_csv("data/colleges.csv") %&gt;%
  mutate(year02 = year - 2002)
```



---

## `college` data
 

```r
college %&gt;% filter(instname == "Duke University")
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 5

### What makes this model different?

- The goal is to understand what factors of a college number of students per 100 who graduate

- There are multiple observations for each college (so multiple regression not appropriate)

- The are only a few time points in the dataset (so time series model not appropriate)

- We will use a **multilevel model** to model this data


---

## Multilevel Model

Our ultimate goal is to fit a model of the following form that contains two components: 

- **Level One**: include time and any other predictors that can change within a college over the time period 

- **Level Two**: includes predictors that differ between colleges but that remain the same within a college over the time period

---

### Modeling Approach 

**Approach:** Start with simple, preliminary models to establish a baseline that can be used to evaluate larger models. Work toward the final model by adding predictors and checking model assumptions at each step. We can take the following steps:

1. Exploratory data analysis 

2. Fit unconditional means model - model with no predictors

3. Fit unconditional growth model - add time

4. Add predictors


---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Given the longitudinal structure of the data, we have observations at different time points for each college in the data set.

- When we do EDA, in addition to an univariate analysis of each variable, we want to look at the following: 
    - **within college**: changes over time within a school
    - **between college**: effects of school-specific predictors (e.g. `faculty`)

---

## Univariate analysis

&lt;img src="24-long-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Rate by Year   

- Let's look at the rate over time for 20 randomly selected colleges

&lt;img src="24-long-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Rate vs. Faculty in 2002

&lt;img src="24-long-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Rate vs. Tuition in 2002

&lt;img src="24-long-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Unconditional Means Model

- In an &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;unconditional means model&lt;/font&gt;, there are no predictors at any level 

- The goal of this model is to compare variability with colleges and variability between colleges 

.alert[
Let `\(Y_{ij}\)` be the rate of college `\(i\)` in year `\(j\)`

`$$Y_{ij} = \alpha_0 + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}\\
u_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_u) \hspace{10mm} \epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$`
]

---

### Rates: Unconditional Means Model

We can fit a multilevel model using the &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;`lmer`&lt;/font&gt; function in the **lme4** package. 


```r
library(lme4)

model_0 &lt;- lmer(rate ~ 1 + (1|instname), data = college)
summary(model_0)
```

---

### Rates: Unconditional Means Model


```
## Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']
## Formula: rate ~ 1 + (1 | instname)
##    Data: college
## 
## REML criterion at convergence: 46259.5
## 
## Scaled residuals: 
##      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
## -13.8804  -0.3614  -0.0223   0.3288  16.4270 
## 
## Random effects:
##  Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.
##  instname (Intercept) 63.35    7.959   
##  Residual             11.18    3.344

```

## Understanding the model

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Coefficients&lt;/font&gt;
    - `\(\hat{\alpha}_0 = 25.591\)`: mean completion rate across all colleges

    - `\(\hat{\sigma}^2_u = 63.35\)`: variance in the between-college deviations between the college means and the overall mean across all colleges and all years

    - `\(\hat{\sigma}^2 = 11.18\)`: variance in within-school deviations between individual rate and college mean across all years
 
--

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Intraclass correlation&lt;/font&gt;
`$$\hat{\rho} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_u}{\hat{\sigma}_u^2 + \hat{\sigma}^2} = \frac{63.35}{63.35 + 11.18} = 0.85$$`

About 85% of the total variation in completion rates can be attributed to the difference among schools rather than the change over time within schools.

---

## Unconditional growth model 

- In an &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;unconditional growth model&lt;/font&gt;, 
there is time added to the Level One model but no predictors in the Level Two model

- The goal of this model is to determine how much of the within-school variability in completion rate can be attributed to changes over time

- We can think of this as building individual models for the change in rate over time for each of the colleges. 
    - We assume the same form of the relationship between `rate` and `year` for every college
    
.alert[
Let `\(Y_{ij}\)` be the `rate` for college `\(i\)` in year `\(j\)`

`$$Y_{ij} = a_i + b_i \text{year02}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}\\
\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$`
]

---

## Unconditional growth model 

.alert[
Let `\(Y_{ij}\)` be the `rate` for college `\(i\)` in year `\(j\)`

`$$Y_{ij} = a_i + b_i \text{year02}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}\\
\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$`
]

- `\(a_i\)`: expected rate for college `\(i\)` `year02 == 0`, i.e. 2002

- `\(b_i\)`: slope for college `\(i\)`, i.e. the rate of change in completion rate for college `\(i\)` over the time period

- `\(\epsilon_{ij}\)`: deviation in college `\(i\)`'s expected and actual completion rate at time `\(j\)`
    - `\(\sigma^2\)` is the variability in the deviations
    
---

## UT: Rate over Time


```r
college %&gt;%
  filter(instname == "The University of Tennessee") %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = year02, y = rate)) +
           geom_point() + geom_line() + 
           labs(x = "Years Since 2002")
```

&lt;img src="24-long-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Unconditional growth model 

- We will let `\(a_i\)` and `\(b_i\)` vary by college, so we will build Level Two models that incorporate school-level variables to estimate these values 


.alert[
Let `\(Y_{ij}\)` be the `rate` for college `\(i\)` in year `\(j\)`

**Level One**

`$$Y_{ij} = a_i + b_i \text{year02}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$`


**Level Two**
`$$a_i = \alpha_0 + u_i \\
b_i = \beta_0 + v_i$$`
]

where `\(\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)` and 

`$$\bigg[\begin{matrix}u \\ v  \end{matrix}\bigg] \sim N\Bigg(\bigg[\begin{matrix}0 \\ 0 \end{matrix}\bigg], \bigg[\begin{matrix}\sigma^2_u &amp;  \sigma_{vu} \\ \sigma_{uv} &amp; \sigma^2_{v} \end{matrix} \bigg] \Bigg)$$`

---

## Unconditional growth model 

- `\(\sigma^2\)`: within-school variability 

- `\(\sigma^2_u\)`: variability in initial rate

- `\(\sigma^2_v\)`: variability in slopes over time

- `\(\sigma^2_u\)` and `\(\sigma^2_v\)` make up the between-school variability 


---

### Rate: Unconditional growth model 


```r
library(lme4)
model_1 &lt;- lmer(rate ~ year02 + (year02|instname), data = college)
summary(model_1)
```

## Understanding model 

What do each of the following values tell you?

- `\(\hat{\alpha}_0 = 25.032\)`: 

- `\(\hat{\beta}_0 = 0.153\)`: 

- `\(\hat{\sigma}^2 = 7.697\)`: 

- `\(\hat{\sigma}^2_u = 62.562\)`: 

- `\(\hat{\sigma}^2_v= 0.757\)`: 

- `\(\rho_{uv} = -0.19\)`: 

---

## Add predictors

- Do `faculty` and `tuition` affect completion rates? 

- We will add these predictor variables to the Level Two model, since they differ by college but didn't change within a college (based on how they're defined)

.alert[
Let `\(Y_{ij}\)` be the `rate` for college `\(i\)` in year `\(j\)`

**Level One**

`$$Y_{ij} = a_i + b_i \text{year02}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$`


**Level Two**
`$$a_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \text{faculty} + \alpha_2 \text{tuition} + u_i \\
b_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{faculty} + \beta_2 \text{tuition} + v_i$$`
]

---

## Add predictors 


```r
library(lme4)
model_2 &lt;- lmer(rate ~ year02 + faculty + tuition  +
                  faculty:year02 + tuition:year02 +
                  (year02|instname), data = college)
summary(model_2)
