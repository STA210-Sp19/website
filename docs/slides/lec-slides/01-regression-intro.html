## Example: Sales vs. Advertising 

- Suppose you are a data scientist on the marketing team and the company wants to improve the sales of their premiere product 

- You want to understand the association between advertising budget and total sales 

- If there is an association between advertising and sales, then you can provide advice to the company about how to adjust the advertising budget to improve sales

```

--

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Observations:&lt;/font&gt; 200 markets

--

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Variables:&lt;/font&gt; 
    - `tv`: Spending on TV ads (in $thousands)
    - `radio`: Spending on radio ads (in $thousands)
    - `newspaper`: Spending on newspaper ads (in $thousands)
    - `sales`: total sales (in $millions)
   
---

## Terminology

- `sales` is the &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;response variable&lt;/font&gt;
    - variable whose variation we want to understand / variable we wish to predict
    - also known as *outcome* or *dependent* variable

--

- `tv`, `radio`, `newspaper` are the &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;predictor variables&lt;/font&gt;
    - variables used to account for variation in the outcome
    - also known as *explanatory*, *independent*, or *input* variables

---

## Advertising vs. Sales


```r
p1 &lt;- advertising %&gt;% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=tv,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="blue",se=FALSE) 

p2 &lt;- advertising %&gt;% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=radio,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red", se=FALSE) 

p3 &lt;- advertising %&gt;% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=newspaper,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="purple", se=FALSE) 

plot_grid(p1,p2,p3,ncol=3)
```

## Plot Data

&lt;img src="01-regression-intro_files/figure-html/show-plot-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

Each line represents model we could use to predict `sales` using `tv`, `radio`, or `newspaper`

---

## Plot Data

&lt;img src="01-regression-intro_files/figure-html/show-plot-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.alert[
`$$\text{sales} = f(\text{tv}, \text{radio}, \text{newspaper}) + \epsilon$$`
]

---

## Model 

.alert[
`$$\text{sales} = f(\text{tv}, \text{radio}, \text{newspaper}) + \epsilon$$`
]

- **Goal**: Estimate `\(f\)`

--

- How do we estimate `\(f\)`?

--

    - &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Non-parametric methods:&lt;/font&gt; estimate `\(f\)` by getting as close to the data points as possible without making explicit assumptions about the functional form of `\(f\)`
    
--

    - &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Parametric methods:&lt;/font&gt; estimate `\(f\)` by making an assumption about the functional form of `\(f\)` then using the data to fit a model based on that form 
    
---

class: middle, center

.alert[
In this class, we will focus on &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;parametric methods&lt;/font&gt;
]

&lt;small&gt;
*Non-parametric methods covered in STA 325: Machine Learning &amp; Data Mining*
&lt;/small&gt;

---

## General form of model

.alert[
`$$Y = f(\mathbf{X}) + \epsilon$$`
]

- `\(Y\)`: quantitative response variable

- `\(\mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p)\)`: predictor variables

- `\(f\)`: fixed but unknown function
    - systematic information `\(\mathbf{X}\)` provides about `\(Y\)`

- `\(\epsilon\)`: random error term with mean 0 that is independent of `\(\mathbf{X}\)` 
   
---

## How to estimate `\(f\)`?

In general, we will use the following steps to estimate `\(f\)`

1. Choose the functional form of `\(f\)`, i.e. &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;choose the appropriate model given the data&lt;/font&gt;
    - Ex: `\(f\)` is a linear model
    `$$f(\mathbf{X}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_p X_p$$`

--

2. Use the data to fit (or train) the model, i.e. &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;estimate the model parameters&lt;/font&gt;
    - Ex: Use a method to estimate the model parameters `\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p\)`

---

## Why estimate `\(f\)`?

Suppose we have the model

`$$\text{sales} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{tv} + \beta_2 \times \text{radio} + \beta_3 \times \text{newspaper} + \epsilon$$`
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

--

.question[
What are 1-2 questions you could answer using this model?
]

---

## Why estimate `\(f\)`?

There are two types of questions we may be interesting in answering with our model: 

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Prediction: &lt;/font&gt; What is the expected `\(Y\)`  given particular values of  `\(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p\)`? 
--

    - Ex: What is the expected `sales` in a market if the company spends $100,000 TV ads, $30,000 on radio ads, and $10,000 on newspaper ads?

--

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Inference: &lt;/font&gt; What is the relationship between `\(\mathbf{X}\)` and `\(Y\)`. How does `\(Y\)` change as a function of `\(\mathbf{X}\)`?
--

    - Ex: Which type of media advertising generates the boost in sales?


---

## Prediction 

`$$\hat{\text{sales}} = \hat{f}(\text{tv},\text{radio}, \text{newspaper})$$`

- **Question**: How accurate is `\(\hat{\text{sales}}\)` as a prediction of `\(\text{sales}\)`?

- This depends on two quantities: reducible and irreducible error

--
    - &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Reducible error:&lt;/font&gt; error that can potentially be reduced by using a model , `\(\hat{f}\)`, that is a more appropriate fit for the data

--
    - &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Irreducible error: &lt;/font&gt; Error that cannot be reduces even if the model, `\(\hat{f}\)`, is a perfect fit. In other words, this is variability associated with `\(\epsilon\)`

---

class: middle, center

.question[
In the case of the `advertising` data, what types of factors are included in the irreducible error?
]

---

## Inference

`$$\hat{\text{sales}} = \hat{f}(\text{tv},\text{radio}, \text{newspaper})$$`

- **Question**: How is `sales` affected as `tv`, `radio`, and `newspaper` change?
--

- We can break this into several questions: 

--
    - What predictors are important for understanding sales? 
--
    - What is the relationship between sales and each predictor? 
--
    - Does the linear model adequately describe the relationship between `sales` and `tv`, `newspaper`, and `radio`? Or is a more complex model required?

## Recap 

- We want to find the function that best fits the relationship between a response variable `\(Y\)` and some predictor variables `\(X_1, \ldots, X_p\)`

- We will use **parametric** methods to find the function 
    - Choose the appropriate model
    - Estimate values of the model parameters

- There are two main purposes for the model: 
    - Prediction 
    - Inference

## Reproducible data analysis

---

## Reproducibility checklist

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

**Near-term goals:**

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

--

**Long-term goals:**

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?
---

## Toolkit

# R and RStudio

---

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)
- At its simplest:&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
    - R is like a car’s engine
    - RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

## R/RStudio Tour

.center[
[DEMO]
]

Concepts introduced:

- Console
- Using R as a calculator
- Environment
- Loading and viewing a data frame
- Accessing a variable in a data frame
- R functions

---

### R essentials (a short list)

- **Functions** are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:


```r
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- **Columns** (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:


```r
dataframe$var_name
```

--

- **Packages** are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:


```r
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

# R Markdown

---


## R Markdown

- Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you knit

- Simple Markdown syntax for text

- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

---

## R Markdown Tour

.center[
[DEMO]
]

--

Concepts introduced:

- Copying a project in RStudio Cloud
- Knitting documents
- R Markdown and (some) R syntax

---

## R Markdown tips

**Resources**
- [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
- Markdown Quick Reference: 
    - `Help -&gt; Markdown Quick Reference`
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
--


**Remember**: The workspace of the R Markdown document is &lt;u&gt;separate&lt;/u&gt; from the console

---

## Workspace vs. console

- Run the following in the console


```r
x &lt;- 2
x * 3
```

--

- Then, add the following chunk in your R Markdown document and knit


```r
x * 3
```

--

.question[
What happens? Why the error?
]

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every assignment / lab / project / etc. is an R Markdown document

- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with

- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester

---
