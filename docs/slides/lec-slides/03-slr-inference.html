## Critic vs. Audience Ratings

- To answer this question, we will analyze the critic and audience scores from rottentomatoes.com.  
    - The data was first used in the article [Be Suspicious of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandango's](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).

- Variables: 
    - `tomatometer`: Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for the film (0 - 100)
    - `audience`: Rotten Tomatoes user score for the film (0 - 100)

## Recap: SLR Basics

## Regression Model 

`$$Y|X \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X,\sigma^2)$$`

&lt;img src="img/03/regression.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- `\(\sigma\)`: the standard deviation of `\(Y\)` as a function of `\(X\)` 

- **Assumption:** `\(\sigma\)` is equal for all values of `\(X\)`

---

## Regression Model

.alert[
`$$\color{blue}{Y|X \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X,\sigma^2)}$$`
]

--

- For a single observation `\((x_i, y_i)\)`

`$$\color{blue}{y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i \hspace{10mm} \epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)}$$`

--

- We want to use the `\(n\)` observations `\((x_1,y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\)` to estimate `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`. We will use *least-squares regression* estimates.

---

## Scatterplot 

&lt;img src="03-slr-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Simple Linear Regression Model


```r
model &lt;- lm(audience ~ tomatometer, data=movie_scores)
tidy(model)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)   32.3      2.34        13.8 4.03e-28
## 2 tomatometer    0.519    0.0345      15.0 2.70e-31
```

- **Slope**: For every one percentage increase in the Tomatometer score, we expect the audience score to increase by 0.519%. 

- **Intercept**: If the Tomatometer score is 0%, we expect the audience score to be about 32.316%.

---

## Assumptions for Regression 

1. &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Linearity: &lt;/font&gt;The plot of the mean value for `\(y\)` against `\(x\)` falls on a straight line

2. &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Constant Variance: &lt;/font&gt;The regression variance is the same for all values of `\(x\)`

3. &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Normality: &lt;/font&gt; For a given `\(x\)`, the distribution of `\(y\)` around its mean is Normal

4. &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Independence: &lt;/font&gt;All observations are independent

---

## Linearity &amp; Constant variance



&lt;img src="03-slr-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- From the scatterplot and plot of the residuals vs. predictor, we conclude the **linearity** assumption is sufficiently met.

- From the plot of the residuals vs. predictor, we conclude the **constant variance** assumption is sufficiently met. 

---

## Normality of residuals 
&lt;img src="03-slr-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- From the histogram and QQ-plot, we conclude that the **Normality** assumption is met.

---

## Independence

- If we assume critics and audiences judge each movie independently, then we could conclude that the independence assumption is reasonably met. 

- There potentially could be a cluster effect due to movie genre, so a good next step would be to analyze the residuals by genre. 

--

- Due to time constraints, let's assume the independence assumption is reasonably met for the class notes.

## Assessing Model Fit

class: regular 

## Estimating Regression Variance

- &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;Residual: &lt;/font&gt;Difference between the observed response and its estimated mean (the predicted response)
  + The residual for the `\(i^{th}\)` observation, `\((X_i, Y_i)\)`, is `$$e_i = Y_i - (\hat{\beta}_0+ \hat{\beta}_1 X_i)$$`
--

- &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;Residual Standard Error (RSE)&lt;/font&gt;: Approximately the average amount the response will deviate from the true regression line. 
    - It is the estimate of `\(\sigma\)`

`$$\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-2}RSS} \hspace{2.5mm} = \hspace{2.5mm} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-2}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$$`

---

## Calculating RSE in R


```r
model %&gt;% sigma()
```

```
## [1] 12.53817
```
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

One way we can use the RSE is to compare the fit of two models. **What is one disadvantage of using the RSE for this purpose?**

---

## `\(R^2\)`

We can use the coefficient of determination, `\(R^2\)`, to measure how well the model fits the data 

- `\(R^2\)` is the proportion of variation in `\(Y\)` that is explained by the regression line (reported as percentage)

- It is difficult to determine what exactly is a "good" value of `\(R^2\)`. It depends on the context of the data.

---

## Calculating `\(R^2\)`

.instructions[
`$$R^2 = \frac{\text{TSS} - \text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}} = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}}$$`
]

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Total Sum of Squares: &lt;/font&gt;Total variation in the `\(Y\)`'s before fitting the regression 

`$$\text{TSS}= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = (n-1)s^2_y$$`

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Residual Sum of Squares (RSS): &lt;/font&gt;Total variation in the `\(Y\)`'s around the regression line (sum of squared residuals)
`$$\text{RSS} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}[y_i - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i)]^2$$`

---

## Rotten Tomatoes Data


```r
rsquare(model,movie_scores)
```

```
## [1] 0.6106479
```

The Tomatometer score explains about 61.06% of the variation in audience scores on rottentomatoes.com.

## Inference for `\(\beta_1\)`

---

## Questions of interest

In our example, we will treat the data as a random sample of movies from rottentomatoes.com

**Questions of interest**
- What is a plausible range of values of the true population slope for `tomatometer`?
- Is there truly a linear relationship between the tomatometer and audience scores? In other words, is there enough evidence to conclude that the true population slope is different from 0?

---

## Statistical Inference

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Confidence Interval: &lt;/font&gt; Estimate a range of plausible values for a parameter

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Hypothesis Test: &lt;/font&gt; Test a specified claim or hypothesis about the parameter

- In this class, our focus will be on inference for regression coefficients, i.e. the `\(\beta_j\)`'s

---

**What is a plausible range of values of the true population slope for `tomatometer`?**

---

## Confidence Intervals

- **What**: Estimates a population parameter using a sample statistic
    - Assuming sample data is a simple random sample
  
- **Why**: Because the statistic is a random variable, its value is subject to chance error
    - We want a range of plausible values for the population parameter that takes the chance error into account

- We assume the data is from a random sample that is representative of the population. A confidence interval will not make up for systematic bias in the data


---

### Understanding 95% Confidence Interval

.center[
&lt;img src="img/03/confidence_intervals.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
- It's a procedure to produce an interval for the parameter of interest
- If we take many samples of size `\(n\)`, the intervals calculated from the sample will contain the parameter about 95% of the time
- It is **not** interpreted as the probability the parameter of interest is in a given interval

---

## General form of the CI

- Let &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;SE&lt;/font&gt; be the standard error of the statistic used to estimate the parameter of interest, then the general form of the confidence interval is

.alert[
`$$\text{ Estimate} \pm \text{ (critical value) } \times \text{SE}$$`
]
- *Note*: The critical value is determined by the distribution of the estimate (statistic) and the confidence level

- For the regression slope: 
    - `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` is the statistic used to estimate the parameter, `\(\beta_1\)` 
    - We will write the confidence interval as 
    `$$\mathbf{\hat{\beta}_1 \pm t^* SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}$$`
    
---

## Confidence interval for `\(\beta_1\)`

- The confidence interval for the regression slope is 

.alert[
`$$\mathbf{\hat{\beta}_1 \pm t^* SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}$$`
]

- `\(t^*\)` is the critical value associated with the confidence level.
  + It is calculated from a `\(t\)` distribution with `\(n-2\)` degrees of freedom
  
- `\(SE(\hat{\beta}_1)\)` is the standard error for the slope 

`$$SE(\hat{\beta}_1) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}} \hspace{2.5mm} = \hspace{2.5mm} \hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{1}{(n-1)s_X^2}}$$`

---

## t-distribution vs. Normal 

- Since we calculate `\(SE(\hat{\beta}_1)\)` using `\(\hat{\sigma}\)`, an estimate of `\(\sigma\)`, we will use the *t* distribution to find the critical value for the confidence interval.

- The critical value `\(t^*\)` is calculated from the *t(n-2)* distribution - the *t* distribution with *n-2* degrees of freedom.

### rottentomatoes: 95% confidence interval for `\(\beta_1\)`


```r
model %&gt;%
  tidy(conf.int=TRUE)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 7
##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)   32.3      2.34        13.8 4.03e-28   27.7      36.9  
## 2 tomatometer    0.519    0.0345      15.0 2.70e-31    0.450     0.587
```

**Interpretation**: 
  
We are 95% confident that the interval (0.450, 0.587) contains `\(\beta_1\)`, the true population slope for `tomatometer`. This means we are 95% confident that for every 1% increase in the tomatometer score, the audience score will increase between 0.45% and 0.587%, on average.

## Hypthesis Tests

Question being answered: 

- Given the data in our sample, is there evidence &lt;u&gt;**against**&lt;/u&gt; a specified hypothesis about the parameter of interest?

- In other words:
    - Are the data consistent with the specified hypothesis?
  
---

## Outline of a Hypothesis Test

- Assume some hypothesis about the parameter is true
    - This hypothesis is the &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;null hypothesis&lt;/font&gt;

- Identify the appropriate statistic based on the distribution of the parameter of interest.
    - This statistic is the &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;test statistic.&lt;/font&gt;
    - The statistic should take an extreme value when the hypothesis is false.

- Use the data in your sample to calculate the value of the test statistic.

---

## Outline of a Hypothesis Test

- Calculate the probability of observing a value of the statistic that is as extreme or more extreme than the observed value, under the assumed hypothesis.
    - This calculated probability is the &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;p-value&lt;/font&gt;.

- Assess the p-value to make your conclusion. 

---

## Conducting a Hypothesis Test 

1. State the hypotheses

2. Calculate the test statistic 

3. Calculate the p-value

4. State the conclusion in the context of the problem

---

### 1. State the hypotheses

- We are often interested in testing whether there is a significant linear relationship between the explanatory and response variable 

- If there is no linear relationship between the two variables, the population regression slope should equal 0 
--

- We can test the hypotheses: 

`$$\begin{aligned}&amp;\mathbf{H_0: \boldsymbol{\beta_1} = 0}\\&amp;\mathbf{H_a: \boldsymbol{\beta_1} \neq 0}\end{aligned}$$`

- This is the test conducted by the `lm()` function in R


---

### 2. Calculate the test statistic

`$$\begin{aligned}&amp;H_0: \boldsymbol{\beta_1} = 0\\&amp;H_a: \boldsymbol{\beta_1} \neq 0\end{aligned}$$`

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Test Statistic: &lt;/font&gt; 
`$$\begin{aligned}\text{test statistic} &amp;= \frac{\text{Estimate} - \text{Hypothesized}}{SE} \\
&amp;= \frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_1 - 0}{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}\end{aligned}$$`

---

### 3. Calculate the p-value

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;p-value:&lt;/font&gt; Calculated from a `\(t\)` distribution with `\(n-2\)` degrees of freedom

`$$\text{p-value} = P(t \geq |\text{test statistic}|)$$`

A small p-value means either....

1. The assumed hypothesis is incorrect or 
2. The assumed hypothesis is correct and a rare event has occurred

---

### 4. State the conclusion 


- State a conclusion about the hypothesis based on the assessment of the p-value.
    - Since event (2) is by definition rare, we will conclude a &lt;font color="green"&gt;small p-value&lt;/font&gt; indicates that there &lt;font color="green"&gt;is sufficient evidence&lt;/font&gt; to claim &lt;font color="green"&gt;that the assumed hypothesis is false&lt;/font&gt;.
    
    - When the p-value is &lt;font color="red"&gt;not small&lt;/font&gt;, we will conclude that there &lt;font color="red"&gt;is not sufficient evidence&lt;/font&gt; to claim the assumed hypothesis is false.

---

### Hypothesis test for coefficient of `tomatometer`


```r
model %&gt;%
  tidy(conf.int=TRUE)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 7
##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)   32.3      2.34        13.8 4.03e-28   27.7      36.9

```

---

### Understanding Hypothesis Tests

---

### Can you define "p-value"?

- [Scientists Define *p*-value](https://fivethirtyeight.abcnews.go.com/video/embed/56150342)

- [Statisticians Found One Thing They Can Agree On: It's Time to Stop Misusing P-Values](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/statisticians-found-one-thing-they-can-agree-on-its-time-to-stop-misusing-p-values/)

---

### What the *p-value* is and is not

**What the p-value is NOT**:
- It is &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; the probability the null hypothesis is true
  + The null hypothesis is either true or not true
- (1 - *p-value*) is &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true
  + The alternative hypothesis is either true or not true
  
.alert[
**What the p-value &lt;u&gt;IS&lt;/u&gt;**

The probability of getting a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the calculated test statistic, *assuming the null hypothesis is true*
]

---

## Interpreting the p-value

|  Magnitude of p-value |             Interpretation            |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| p-value &lt; 0.01        | strong evidence against `\(H_0\)`         |
| 0.01 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.05 | moderate evidence against `\(H_0\)`       |
| 0.05 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.1  | weak evidence against `\(H_0\)`           |
| p-value &gt; 0.1         | effectively no evidence against `\(H_0\)` |
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;

**Note:** These are general guidelines. The strength of evidence depends on the context of the problem.

---

## Statistical Significance

- A threshold can be used to decide whether or not to reject `\(H_0\)`. 

- This threshold is called the &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;significance level&lt;/font&gt; and is usually denoted by `\(\alpha\)`

- When `\(H_0\)` is rejected, we use the term &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt; statistically significant &lt;/font&gt; to describe the outcome of the test.

- *Example*: When `\(\alpha = 0.05\)`, results are statistically significance when the p-value is `\(&lt; 0.05\)`

---

## Statistical Significance

- Do not rely strictly on the significance level to make a conclusion!
--

- Suppose the significance level is 0.05
--

  + If the p-value is 0.05001, we do not reject `\(H_0\)`
--

  + If the p-value is 0.04999, we do reject `\(H_0\)`
--

- 0.05001 and 0.04999 are practically the same, yet they led to different conclusions. 
--

- Always state the p-value when reporting results and assess their magnitude in the context of your problem. 

---

### Not Statistically Significant

- An outcome of failing to reject `\(H_0\)` is &lt;u&gt;**not**&lt;/u&gt; a failed study/experiment

- Obtaining an outcome of "no significant effect" or "no significant difference" is still valid 

- It is often just as important to learn that the `\(H_0\)` can't be refuted

---

## Type I &amp;  Type II Errors

&lt;img src="img/03/errors.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
.small[
Image: *The Basic Practice of Statistics (7th Ed.)*
]

- &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;Type I Error&lt;/font&gt;: Reject `\(H_0\)` when `\(H_0\)` is true
- &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;Type II Error&lt;/font&gt;: Fail to reject `\(H_0\)` when `\(H_1\)` is true
- Replicate study when possible to reduce these errors

---

## Sample Size

- Probability of Type I error is not affected by the sample size
    - What affects the probability of Type I error?
--

- Probability of Type II error decreases as the sample size increases
--

- If the hypothesized value is not very different from actual parameter value, you need a large sample size
--

- When designing a study, it is good practice to conduct a power analyses to determine the sample size required to minimize the chance of Type II error

---

class: regular 

## Sample Size

- It is always preferable to collect as much data as possible (as long as it is accurate and relevant)
--

- A test can reject almost any false `\(H_0\)`, i.e. detect even very small effects, when the sample size is large enough
--

- *Note*: Statistical significance is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; the same as practical significance 
  + Even if `\(H_0\)` is rejected, the detected effect may be too small to be of any practical use
