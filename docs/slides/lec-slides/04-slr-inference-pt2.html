## Carbs vs. alcohol in beer

- **What is the relationship between the percentage of alcohol and the amount of carbohydrates in beer?**

- The dataset contains the following characteristics for 173 domestic beers: 
    - `Brand`
    - `Brewery`
    - `PercentAlcohol`
    - `CaloriesPer12Oz`
    - `Carbohydrates` (in grams)

## Inference for `\(\beta_1\)`

---

## Statistical Inference

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Confidence Interval: &lt;/font&gt; Estimate a range of plausible values for a parameter

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Hypothesis Test: &lt;/font&gt; Test a specified claim or hypothesis about the parameter

- In this class, our focus will be on inference for regression coefficients, i.e. the `\(\beta_j\)`'s

---

## Confidence Intervals

- **What**: Estimates a population parameter using a sample statistic
    - Assuming sample data is a simple random sample
  
- **Why**: Because the statistic is a random variable, its value is subject to chance error
    - We want a range of plausible values for the population parameter that takes the chance error into account

- We assume the data is from a random sample that is representative of the population. A confidence interval will not make up for systematic bias in the data

---

## Confidence interval for `\(\beta_1\)`

- The confidence interval for the regression slope is 

.alert[
`$$\mathbf{\hat{\beta}_1 \pm t^* SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}$$`
]

- `\(t^*\)` is the critical value associated with the confidence level.
  + It is calculated from a `\(t\)` distribution with `\(n-2\)` degrees of freedom
  
- `\(SE(\hat{\beta}_1)\)` is the standard error for the slope 

`$$SE(\hat{\beta}_1) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}} \hspace{2.5mm} = \hspace{2.5mm} \hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{1}{(n-1)s_X^2}}$$`

**Is there truly a linear relationship between the percent alcohol and amount of carbohydrates in a domestic beer?** 

**In other words, is there enough evidence to conclude that the true population slope for percent alcohol is different from 0?**

## Hypthesis Tests

Question being answered: 

- Given the data in our sample, is there evidence &lt;u&gt;**against**&lt;/u&gt; a specified hypothesis about the parameter of interest?

- In other words:
    - Are the data consistent with the specified hypothesis?
  
---

## Outline of a Hypothesis Test

- Assume some hypothesis about the parameter is true
    - This hypothesis is the &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;null hypothesis&lt;/font&gt;

- Identify the appropriate statistic based on the distribution of the parameter of interest.
    - This statistic is the &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;test statistic.&lt;/font&gt;
    - The statistic should take an extreme value when the hypothesis is false.

- Use the data in your sample to calculate the value of the test statistic.

---

## Outline of a Hypothesis Test

- Calculate the probability of observing a value of the statistic that is as extreme or more extreme than the observed value, under the assumed hypothesis.
    - This calculated probability is the &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;p-value&lt;/font&gt;.

- Assess the p-value to make your conclusion. 

---

## Conducting a Hypothesis Test 

1. State the hypotheses

2. Calculate the test statistic 

3. Calculate the p-value

4. State the conclusion in the context of the problem

---

### 1. State the hypotheses

- We are often interested in testing whether there is a significant linear relationship between the explanatory and response variable 

- If there is no linear relationship between the two variables, the population regression slope should equal 0 
--

- We can test the hypotheses: 

`$$\begin{aligned}&amp;\mathbf{H_0: \boldsymbol{\beta_1} = 0}\\&amp;\mathbf{H_a: \boldsymbol{\beta_1} \neq 0}\end{aligned}$$`

- This is the test conducted by the `lm()` function in R


---

### 2. Calculate the test statistic

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Test Statistic: &lt;/font&gt; 
`$$\begin{aligned}\text{test statistic} &amp;= \frac{\text{Estimate} - \text{Hypothesized}}{SE} \\
&amp;= \frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_1 - 0}{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}\end{aligned}$$`

- **Interpretation**: The number of standard errors the estimated slope is from the mean of the distribution, the hypothesized slope, given `\(H_0\)` is true

---

### 3. Calculate the p-value

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;p-value:&lt;/font&gt; Calculated from a `\(t\)` distribution with `\(n-2\)` degrees of freedom

`$$\text{p-value} = P(t \geq |\text{test statistic}|)$$`

A small p-value means either....

1. The assumed hypothesis is incorrect or 
2. The assumed hypothesis is correct and a rare event has occurred

---

### 4. State the conclusion 


- State a conclusion about the hypothesis based on the assessment of the p-value.
    - Since event (2) is by definition rare, we will conclude a &lt;font color="green"&gt;small p-value&lt;/font&gt; indicates that there &lt;font color="green"&gt;is sufficient evidence&lt;/font&gt; to claim &lt;font color="green"&gt;that the assumed hypothesis is false&lt;/font&gt;.
    
    - When the p-value is &lt;font color="red"&gt;not small&lt;/font&gt;, we will conclude that there &lt;font color="red"&gt;is not sufficient evidence&lt;/font&gt; to claim the assumed hypothesis is false.

### Understanding Hypothesis Tests

---

### What the *p-value* is and is not

**What the p-value is NOT**:
- It is &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; the probability the null hypothesis is true
  + The null hypothesis is either true or not true
- (1 - *p-value*) is &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true
  + The alternative hypothesis is either true or not true
  
.alert[
**What the p-value &lt;u&gt;IS&lt;/u&gt;**

The probability of getting a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the calculated test statistic, *assuming the null hypothesis is true*
]

---

## Interpreting the p-value

|  Magnitude of p-value |             Interpretation            |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| p-value &lt; 0.01        | strong evidence against `\(H_0\)`         |
| 0.01 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.05 | moderate evidence against `\(H_0\)`       |
| 0.05 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.1  | weak evidence against `\(H_0\)`           |
| p-value &gt; 0.1         | effectively no evidence against `\(H_0\)` |
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;

**Note:** These are general guidelines. The strength of evidence depends on the context of the problem.

---

## Statistical Significance

- A threshold can be used to decide whether or not to reject `\(H_0\)`. 

- This threshold is called the &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;significance level&lt;/font&gt; and is usually denoted by `\(\alpha\)`

- When `\(H_0\)` is rejected, we use the term &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt; statistically significant &lt;/font&gt; to describe the outcome of the test.

- *Example*: When `\(\alpha = 0.05\)`, results are statistically significance when the p-value is `\(&lt; 0.05\)`

---

## Statistical Significance

- Do not rely strictly on the significance level to make a conclusion!
--

- Suppose the significance level is 0.05
--

  + If the p-value is 0.05001, we do not reject `\(H_0\)`
--

  + If the p-value is 0.04999, we do reject `\(H_0\)`
--

- 0.05001 and 0.04999 are practically the same, yet they led to different conclusions. 
--

- Always state the p-value when reporting results and assess their magnitude in the context of your problem. 

---

### Not Statistically Significant

- An outcome of failing to reject `\(H_0\)` is &lt;u&gt;**not**&lt;/u&gt; a failed study/experiment

- Obtaining an outcome of "no significant effect" or "no significant difference" is still valid 

- It is often just as important to learn that the `\(H_0\)` can't be refuted

---

## Type I &amp;  Type II Errors

&lt;img src="img/03/errors.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
.small[
Image: *The Basic Practice of Statistics (7th Ed.)*
]

- &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;Type I Error&lt;/font&gt;: Reject `\(H_0\)` when `\(H_0\)` is true
- &lt;font class="vocab3"&gt;Type II Error&lt;/font&gt;: Fail to reject `\(H_0\)` when `\(H_1\)` is true
- Replicate study when possible to reduce these errors

---

## Sample Size

- Probability of Type I error is not affected by the sample size
    - What affects the probability of Type I error?
--

- Probability of Type II error decreases as the sample size increases
--

- If the hypothesized value is not very different from actual parameter value, you need a large sample size
--

- When designing a study, it is good practice to conduct a power analyses to determine the sample size required to minimize the chance of Type II error

---

class: regular 

## Sample Size

- It is always preferable to collect as much data as possible (as long as it is accurate and relevant)
--

- A test can reject almost any false `\(H_0\)`, i.e. detect even very small effects, when the sample size is large enough
--

- *Note*: Statistical significance is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; the same as practical significance 
  + Even if `\(H_0\)` is rejected, the detected effect may be too small to be of any practical use

## Predictions 

---

class: regular

### Predictions for New Observations 

- We can use the regression model to predict for a response at `\(x_0\)`

`$$\hat{y} =  \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_0$$`
&lt;br&gt; 

- In other words, we have the same estimate whether we want to predict the mean response at `\(x_0\)` or an individual response at `\(x_0\)`.

class: regular 

## Beer data

.instructions[
What is the predicted amount of carbohydrates (in grams) for a beer with 5% alcohol?
]

.instructions[
What is the average predicted amount of carbohydrates (in grams) for the subset of beers with 5% alcohol?
]

---

class: regular 

### Predictions for New Observations 

- There is uncertainty in our predictions, so we need to calculate an SE to capture the uncertainty

- The SE is different depending on whether you are predicting an average value or an individual value

- SE is larger when predicting for an individual value than for an average value 

---

### Beer data: predicting mean

- We wish to predict the &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;mean&lt;/font&gt; carbohydrates for the subset of beers with 5% alcohol. 



```r
x0 &lt;- data.frame(PercentAlcohol=5)
*predict.lm(model,x0,interval="confidence",conf.level=0.95)
```

```
##        fit      lwr    upr
## 1 11.63853 10.96005 12.317
```

- Interpret the interval in the context of the data.

---

### Beer data: predicting individual

- We wish to predict the amount of carbohydrates for a &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;certain&lt;/font&gt; beer with 5% alcohol. 



```r
x0 &lt;- data.frame(PercentAlcohol=5)
*predict.lm(model,x0,interval="prediction",conf.level=0.95)
```

```
##        fit      lwr      upr
## 1 11.63853 3.178022 20.09903
```

- Interpret the interval in the context of the data.

---

class: middle, center

## Cautions

---

## Caution: Extrapolation

- The regression is only useful for predictions for the response variable `\(Y\)` in the range of the explanatory variable `\(X\)` that was used to fit the regression 

- It is risky to predict far beyond that range of `\(X\)`, since you don't have data to tell whether or not the relationship continues to follow a straight line


---

## Caution: Extrapolation

&lt;img src="04-slr-inference-pt2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

We should not use the regression model to predict the amount of carbohydrates for beers with approximately more than 12% alcohol or beers with approximately less than 1%

---

### Caution: Correlation `\(\neq\)` Causation

- The regression model is **&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;** a statement of causality
  + The regression model provides a description of the averages of `\(Y\)` for different values of `\(X\)`


- The regression model alone **&lt;u&gt;cannot&lt;/u&gt;** prove causality. You need either
  - Randomized experiment
  - Observational study in which all relevant confounding variables are controlled for adequately
