### Multinomial Logistic Regression Example
### *Sesame Street*
---

### Example: *Sesame Street*

- We will analyze data from an experiment to test the effectiveness of the children's program *Sesame Street*. 

- As part of the experiment, children were assigned to one of two groups: those who were encouraged to watch the program and those who were not

- We want to understand what effect the encouragement had on the frequency of viewing after adjusting for other factors

---

### Response Variable

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;`viewcat`&lt;/font&gt;
  + 1: rarely watched show
  + 2: once or twice a week
  + 3: three to five times a week
  + 4: watched show on average more than five times a week
  
---

### Predictor Variables

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;`age`:&lt;/font&gt; child's age in months
- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;`prenumb`: &lt;/font&gt;score on numbers pretest (0 to 54)
- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;`prelet`: &lt;/font&gt;score on letters pretest (0 to 58)
- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;`viewenc`:&lt;/font&gt; 1: encouraged to watch, 2: not encouraged
- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;`site:`&lt;/font&gt;
  + 1: three to five year old from disadvantaged inner city area
  + 2: four year old from advantaged suburban area
  + 3: from advantaged rural area
  + 4: from disadvantaged rural area
  + 5: from Spanish speaking home

## Model Validation 

---

## Model Validation 

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Goal: &lt;/font&gt; Want to find set of variables that give the lowest test (not training) error
    - Want a model that is generalizable, i.e. can be used to make predictions for new observations

- If we have a large data set, we can achieve this goal by randomly splitting the data into training and test (validation) sets

- Use the training set to fit a model, then use the fitted model to predict the responses for the observations in the test set 

- Assess the error when applied to the test set and choose the model with the lowest error
    
---

## Error

- **Quantitative response**: use Mean Square Error

.alert[
`$$MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$`
]

--

- **Categorical response**: use misclassification rate

.alert[
`$$\text{Misclassification Rate} = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Err_{i} = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} I(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i)$$`
]

---

### Training and test set

- There is no set split for the training and test sets. Common splits are
    - 50% training; 50% test
    - 80% training; 20% test
 
- Assigning observations to training and test sets: 
    - Random assignment
    - Pick a certain time point to make split, if data is collected over time. Generally use earlier data in training and later data in test.
    - Use other relevant characteristic to make split 

---

## Cautions 

- Be sure the training set is large enough to build a reliable model    
    - The number of observations should be at least 10 times larger than the number of predictors 
    
- Standard errors for model coefficients fit using training data are larger than standard errors if entire dataset was used
    - If the training set is reasonably large, then the difference in standard errors is small
    
- The test error is highly variable depending on which observations are in the test set

---

## k-fold Cross Validation

- There are numerous validation methods that address the variability in testing error; we will focus on &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;k-fold cross validation&lt;/font&gt;
    - More in-depth discussion of model validation in STA 325

--

- **k-fold Cross Validation**
    + Randomly split the data into `\(k\)` folds (typically 5 or 10)
    + Use `\(k-1\)` folds to fit a model (this is the training data)
    + Assess how well model predicts on remaining fold (this is the test data) 
    + Repeat `\(k\)` using a different fold as the test set each time

--

- Calculate estimated testing error by average the `\(k\)` different error rates

--

- Once the variables for the final model have been selected, use the entire dataset to estimate coefficients for final model

---

### 5-fold Cross Validation in R

- Split data into 5 folds. Don't forget to set a seed!


```r
library(modelr)
set.seed(04012019)
mydata_cv &lt;- crossv_kfold(my.data, 5)
```


- Fit model on each training set


```r
models &lt;- map(mydata_cv$train, ~ lm(Y ~ X1 + ... + XP, data = .))
```

- Calculate MSE on each test set


```r
# map2_dbl in purrr package that's loaded with tidyverse
test_mse &lt;- map2_dbl(models, mydata_cv$test, mse)
```

---

## Example: Advertising

We want to use spending on TV, radio, and newspaper advertising ($thousands) to predict total sales ($millions). The data contains the advertising and sales for 200 markets.


```r
advertising &lt;- read_csv("data/advertising.csv")
glimpse(advertising)
```

```
## Observations: 200
## Variables: 4
## $ tv        &lt;dbl&gt; 230.1, 44.5, 17.2, 151.5, 180.8, 8.7, 57.5, 120.2, 8.6…
## $ radio     &lt;dbl&gt; 37.8, 39.3, 45.9, 41.3, 10.8, 48.9, 32.8, 19.6, 2.1, 2…
## $ newspaper &lt;dbl&gt; 69.2, 45.1, 69.3, 58.5, 58.4, 75.0, 23.5, 11.6, 1.0, 2…
## $ sales     &lt;dbl&gt; 22.1, 10.4, 9.3, 18.5, 12.9, 7.2, 11.8, 13.2, 4.8, 10.…
```

We'll start by looking at the 5-fold cross validation results for the model using the predictors `radio` and `newspaper`

### Adveritising: Split into 5 folds

.small[

```r
set.seed(04012019)
ad_cv &lt;- crossv_kfold(advertising, 5)
ad_cv
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 3
##   train          test           .id  
##   &lt;list&gt;         &lt;list&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;
## 1 &lt;S3: resample&gt; &lt;S3: resample&gt; 1    
## 2 &lt;S3: resample&gt; &lt;S3: resample&gt; 2    
## 3 &lt;S3: resample&gt; &lt;S3: resample&gt; 3    
## 4 &lt;S3: resample&gt; &lt;S3: resample&gt; 4    
## 5 &lt;S3: resample&gt; &lt;S3: resample&gt; 5
```
