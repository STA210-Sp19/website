### Lab 08: Multinomial Logistic Regression 

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Goal&lt;/font&gt;: Create a multinomial logistic regression model to understand the relationship between a person's political views and their attitude towards government spending on mass transportation

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Data&lt;/font&gt;: General Social Survey, a survey conducted since 1972 that tracks trends in attitudes towards various societal issues along with behavioral trends. You will use results from the 2016 survey. 

- Use the [lecture notes](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring19/sta210.001/slides/lec-slides/18-multinomial-logistic-pt2.html#1) for help with concepts and code.

## Working with large data 

- GitHub will warn you when pushing files larger than 50 MB, and you will not be allowed to push files larger than 100 MB.

- The size of the data file we're working with it 34.3 MB.  Compare that to the Spotify dataset from last weeks' lab which was 149 KB (0.149 MB)!

- While our file is smaller than these limits, it's still large enough to not push to GitHub.

- `gitignore`: Contains a list of the files you don't want to to commit to Git or push to GitHub.
    -  If you open the `.gitignore` file in your project, you'll see that our data file, `gss2016.csv`, is already listed there.
    - You won't be pushing the data to GitHub, but since each team member will have the data in their projects, you can still all work with it.
    - **Don't touch the data file though!** Git isn't tracking it, so you nobody will be able to tell if you modify it. Just read it in, and work with it in R.

## Getting started with the lab

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-06** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and click OK. 

- Run the following in the console to configure Git:


```r
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
```

- **Use the email address associated with your GitHub account**

---

## Caching your password

You need to cache your password on a per-project basis: 

- Go to the **Terminal** within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for `\(60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800\)` seconds


```bash
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.
